Git
  A git repository is a collection of points in time with history showing where you've been
  Each point has a unique hash
  A "branch" is a label that points to a specific point in time
  "Master" branch is the main, present version of your project
    +Separation of the master branch from testing branches keeps bugs from being introduced into the main version of the project
  -to destroy a local repository, delete the hidden .git folder
<<<<<<< HEAD
  -After pushing, developers make pull requests when they have completed their work.
  -a pull request lets the manager of the project know that work is ready to be reviewed

Git Workflow:
  1. modify/create a file
  2. add (stage) the file
  3. commit the change - snapshot of that file at that point in time is saved
    -until you commit, nothing is permanent

Git Commands and such
  git init = initialize a new repository in the working directory (use only once)
  git status = shows information about the current state of your repository - use it to see which files need to be added and which have been changed and are awaiting commits
  git add = adds files to the staging area
  git commit = commits the change
    -m = adds a message in quotations -- 'git commit -m "message or comments here"'
      if you do not use the -m flag, it will open a text editor to add your comment
    each commit saves:
      -the changes made to each file on the stage
      -the identity of the person who made the changes
      -date and time of change
      -brief message about nature of changes
      -universally unique id for the changes
  git log = shows log of changes made to the repository
    can be displayed in a variety of ways
  git branch "new branch name"= creates a new branch for your repo
    - git branch (with no name) shows active branch with an asterisk before it
  git push = sends changes from local repository to a remote
  git pull = rolls two commands into one step
    -fetches changes
    -merges branches
